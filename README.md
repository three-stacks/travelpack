## About Travelpack

### Travelpack takes the stress away from planning group trips by creating a central location for messaging and planning. Think of us as GroupMe for trips!

Travelpack is a cross platform application that allows users to communicate in real time as they plan their trips. Users can search through tourist attractions and add items to the group(pack) itinerary. Once the item is on the group itinerary, pack members can gage the groups interest throught a polling feature. Travelpack comes with a built in budget calculator that helps packs estimate the cost of the trip as well as an agenda to help members track what anything what they need to do to prepare for the trip. 

During the trip, users can utilize travelpack's find my pack feature to pin point the real time locations of their pack members and upload photos to the pack photo album to keeps all of their memories in one place!

## About Travelpack

### Travelpack takes the stress away from planning group trips by creating a central location for messaging and planning. Think of us as GroupMe for trips!

Travelpack is a cross platform application that allows users to communicate in real time as they plan their trips. Users can search through tourist attractions and add items to the group (pack) itinerary. Once the attractions are in the group itinerary, pack members can gage group interest through a polling feature. Travelpack comes with a built in budget calculator that helps packs estimate the cost of their trip as well as a packing list.

During the trip, users can utilize Travelpack’s Find My Pack feature to pinpoint real time locations of pack members and upload photos to the pack photo album to keeps all of their memories in one place!

The schema for Travelpack was designed with packs in the center. Packs have a one to many relationship with the itinerary, map, photo, budget, and message to ensure that only members within each pack have access to the data thereby maintaining each pack (group) privacy.
